# What A Weather

**What A Weather** is a MERN stack, fully responsive application that provides current weather information for any city. Users can search for a city, and the app will display the weather details, including temperature, humidity, and other key metrics. The app is powered by Redux for state management, features professional color grading, and is built with componentization principles. Additionally, it includes a custom search dropdown for a smoother user experience.
